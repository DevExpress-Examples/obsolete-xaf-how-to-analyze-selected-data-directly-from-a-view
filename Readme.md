# OBSOLETE - How to analyze selected data directly from a view - In place Analysis


<p><strong>=================================</strong><br /><strong>This example is now obsolete. Instead,Â refer to theÂ <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument3049">How to: Add the Analyze Action to List Views</a>Â topic in XAF documentation.</strong><br /><strong>=================================</strong><br />This example is a possible solution forÂ the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/S30834">PivotChart - Support inplace analysis feature</a> Â feature request. The main work is done by the ShowInAnalysisViewController and two helper controllers that provide a ShowInAnalysis action with the ability to select the required report.<br /> To use it, first select the required objects in the view, and then execute the ShowInAnalysisAction action. In general, this feature works very similarly to the analogous feature for our Report module described here: <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument3018">Show Reports for Individual Views</a>.<br /> Â <br /> <strong>See Also:</strong><br /> <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/S30834">PivotChart - Support inplace analysis feature</a><br /> <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E389">How to Add the Analyze Action to List Views</a></p>
